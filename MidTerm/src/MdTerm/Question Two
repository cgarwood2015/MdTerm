a. What is compilation? What does the compiler do?
==================================================
When a programmer writes a program, the computer is not able to execute the syntax that is written for the programmer as 
the computer only understands machine language. There are two types of programming languages, the interpretive language - 
code is converted to machine language at the time of execution and compiled language - code is converted to machine
language at development time.  The compiled code is what is deployed for execution.  Compilation is the process of converting 
program syntax (source code) to machine language and the compiler is the tool that converts the program syntax to machine language.

The compiler carries out the following functions:
1. Detect syntax error at development during development (particularly when integrated with development environment eg. Eclipse)
2. To check at compile time for syntax error.
3. To convert source code into machine language (in some cases executables).


b. How many control statements does java have? Name the control statements of Java.  
Give at least 1 example of each.
=====================================================================================================================
Java has 7 control statements broken down as selection statements and repetition statements.
These are:

(i) If selection statement e.g. if(studentGrade >= 60){ System.out.println("Pass");}

(ii) If/Else selection statement 
e.g.  if(studentGrade >= 60){
			System.out.println("Pass");
	  }else{
	  		System.out.println("Failed");
	  }
	  
(iii) while statement e.g. while(product <= 100){ product = product * 3; }

(iv) do while repetition statement e.g. 
do{
	System.out.println("This is a do while");
	counter++;
  }do while(counter <= 10);
	
(v) For repetition statement and enhance for e.g.
for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
	System.out.println("For counter..");
}		 	  		 		

(vi) Switch multiple selection statement

e.g. 
int grade;
switch(grade/10){
	case 9:
	case 10:
		aCounter++
		break;
	case 8:
		bCounter++
		break;
	case 7:
		cCounter++;
		break;
	case 6:
		dCounter++;
		break;
	default:
		fCounter++;
		break;
}						
		
(vii) Conditonal Operator
eg. System.out.println((studentGrade >= 60)? "Pass":"Fail");


c. Draw an activity diagram for define code
===========================================
 See image WhileAndIfActivityDiagram.jpeg
 
 
 d.Write a for loop that sums even integers  from 4 through 54 And prints out the final result only.
 ================================================================================================== 
 
 Program
 =======
 package MdTerm;

public class SumEvenIntegers {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int result = 0;
		
		for(int i = 4;i <= 54;i+=2){
			//just to ensure, this is so not neccessary but Im making sure
			if(i % 2== 0){
				result = result + i;
			}
		}
		System.out.printf("The total of integer between 4 and 54 is:%d",result);
		
	}

}
 
Output
=====
The total of integer between 4 and 54 is:754
