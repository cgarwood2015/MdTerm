a. Define the term algorithm.  What are algorithm good for?
=============================================================

An algorithm is a set of actions that is executed in a specific order to solve a specific problem.
Each action must be executed and the order of the action must be followed to a tee for the algorithm
to be successful.

You may define an algorithm for any mondane procedure for example how to bake a cake, the algorithm 
might be (i) gather ingredients (ii) blend fruits (iii) beat eggs  (iv) mix sugar and butter  
(v) add beaten eggs to sugar and butter (vi) add blended fruits (vii) add remaining ingredients
(viii) mix together ingredients (ix) grease baking tin (x) pour mixture in tin 
(xi) bake in oven at 350F.  Its very important to execute the action in the order specified, for example
if you bake in the oven before you add the beaten eggs the result for the cake would be very
different and most likely be unsuccessful.

Algorithms are used in computer science to outline solutions to problems, their usefulness however goes far beyond 
computer science.  Algorithms can be used in any field, especially mathematics and science, where 
solutions are exact and not subjective.  Algorithms are a designer's expression of a solution to a particular problem, 
in other words its a designers structured thoughts as to how they would solve a particular problem.      


b. What is UML? What is it good for?
====================================
Defining your algorithms is just the first step in designing a programming solution.  
Software Engineers will then have to make the decision what language will be used to 
implement that solution.  If the decision is made to use an object oriented oriented
design then a number a number of processes should be followed to move the solution from
the design phase to implementation, this process is known as object oriented analysis
and design process (OOAD).

UML, i.e. THe Unified Modeling Language, has emerged as the most widely used scheme
for modeling object oriented systems and guide the OOAD process.  UML is a graphical is a graphical 
scheme that provides a standard for visualizing the design of a object oriented system.

The language express the solution to a software system through the use of about 14 different diagrams 
such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams etc.  The important point to note is that 
UML is a language, not a procedure or a method - it does not specify the method or process.


=========================================================================================================
c. Write a program that decides whether integer number input1 can be devided by integer input2 without 
remainder.  The program should output "No Remainder" and "Remainder is:" if there is any.  In the latter
case, the program should output the value of the remainder as well.
=========================================================================================================

Program
=======
package MdTerm;

/**
 * Class			Remainder
 * Methods:  		Takes two integer divide one by the other and return the remainder
 * 					Output either No Remainder of the Remainder value
 * 
 * Exceptions:		NONE
 * 					  
 * 
 */
public class Remainder {

	public static void main(String[] args) {  //Main
		int iValue=0,lValue=0,remainder=0;
		String sRemainder = "";
		
		while(iValue  != -1){
			System.out.printf("Please enter integer 1(-1 to exit):");
			if((iValue = ScannerUtility.getArithmeticInput()) == -1){  //Input and test input
				continue;
			}
			
			System.out.printf("Please enter integer 2(-1 to exit):");
			if((lValue = ScannerUtility.getArithmeticInput()) == -1){  //Input and test input
				iValue = -1;
				continue;
			}
			
			remainder = iValue % lValue;
			sRemainder = (remainder <= 0)? "No Remainder" : "Remainder is: "+remainder;
			
			System.out.printf("%s%n%n",sRemainder);
		}
	}  //End Main
}

Output
========
Please enter integer 1(-1 to exit):5
Please enter integer 2(-1 to exit):3
Remainder is: 2

Please enter integer 1(-1 to exit):5
Please enter integer 2(-1 to exit):2
Remainder is: 1

Please enter integer 1(-1 to exit):10
Please enter integer 2(-1 to exit):2
No Remainder

Please enter integer 1(-1 to exit):-1

d. Write a program line that generates the following stream output:
Fist Name: My_First_Name;
Last Name: My_Last_Name;
====================================================================
