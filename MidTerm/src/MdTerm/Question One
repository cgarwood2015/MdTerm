a. Define the term algorithm.  What are algorithm good for?
=============================================================

An algorithm is a set of actions that is executed in a specific order to solve a specific problem.
Each action must be executed and the order of the action must be followed to a tee for the algorithm
to be successful.

You may define an algorithm for any mondane procedure for example how to bake a cake, the algorithm 
might be (i) gather ingredients (ii) blend fruits (iii) beat eggs  (iv) mix sugar and butter  
(v) add beaten eggs to sugar and butter (vi) add blended fruits (vii) add remaining ingredients
(viii) mix together ingredients (ix) grease baking tin (x) pour mixture in tin 
(xi) bake in oven at 350F.  Its very important to execute the action in the order specified, for example
if you bake in the oven before you add the beaten eggs the result for the cake would be very
different and most likely be unsuccessful.

Algorithms are used in computer science to outline solutions to problems, their usefulness however goes far beyond 
computer science.  Algorithms can be used in any field, especially mathematics and science, where 
solutions are exact and not subjective.  Algorithms are a designer's expression of a solution to a particular problem, 
in other words its a designers structured thoughts as to how they would solve a particular problem.      


b. What is UML? What is it good for?
